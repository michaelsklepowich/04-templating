# Kilovolt blog (with handlebars)

**Author**: Michael & Tim
**Version**: 4.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
The application is a blog that displays posts generated through jQuery methods and Handlebar templates. We're building it to improve the ability to edit and add new content

## Getting Started
User would start with basic html and css, then add the .js files with access to jQuery methods and Handlebar notation

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, with links to jQuery and Handlebars scripts. Design would also include provided fonts and icons
